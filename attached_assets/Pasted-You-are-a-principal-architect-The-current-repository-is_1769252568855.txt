You are a principal architect.
The current repository is incorrect because you kept the old architecture and added new folders on top of it.
This is NOT acceptable.
You must:
- DELETE unused or duplicated folders.
- MOVE files into the new structure.
- End with ONLY ONE final architecture.
===================================================

fliptracker/packages/domain
fliptracker/plugins
fliptracker/infra
